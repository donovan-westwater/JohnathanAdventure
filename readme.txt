This mod / my final project is an endless mode, with the twist being that the only way to move efficently is to use the grappling hook.

HOW TO PLAY:
  Pick any map in both single or multiplayer
  The enemies will spawn in 30 sec, and the time between waves is 30 sec
  You will get ammo at the start of each wave
  you will get an upgrade of some kind also at the start of each wave (Invincibility, quad, or increasing max health)
  Survive as many waves as you can
  
  
  
  Chaingun: Push gun, low damage pushes enemies
  Railgun: Pull gun, high damage pulls enemies
  Blaster: Short range high damage gun
